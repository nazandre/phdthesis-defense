  Abstract                 = {Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are infrastructureless and distributed communication systems that require sophisticated approaches to routing to cope with node mobility and heterogeneous application requirements. In the past few years, distributed hash table (DHT) has come forth as a useful additional technique to the design and specification of spontaneous and self-organized networks. Researchers have exploited its advantages by implementing it at the network layer and developing scalable routing protocols for MANETs. The implementation of DHT-based routing in a MANET requires different algorithms and specifications compared to routing in the Internet because a MANET has its unique characteristics, such as node mobility, spontaneous networking, decentralized architecture, limited transmission range, dynamic topology, and frequent network partitioning/merging.

In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of research related to DHT-based routing that aims at enhancing the scalability of MANETs. We present a vivid taxonomy of DHT-based routing protocols and the guidelines to design such protocols for MANETs. We compare the features, strengths, and weaknesses of existing DHT-based routing protocols and highlight key research challenges that are vital to address. The outcome of the analysis serves as a guide for anyone willing to delve into research on DHT-based routing in MANETs.

Our effort envisions multi-million-module robot ensembles able to morph into three-dimensional scenes, eventually with sufficient fidelity so as to convince a human observer the scenes are real. Although this work is potentially revolutionary in the sense that it holds out the possibility of radically altering the relationship between computation, humans, and the physical world, many of the research questions involved are similar in flavor to more mainstream systems research, albeit larger in scale. For instance, as in sensor networks, each robot will incorporate sensing, computation, and communications components. However, unlike most sensor networks each robot will also include mechanisms for actuation and motion. Many of the key challenges in this project involve coordination and communication of sensing and actuation across such large ensembles of independent units.},

Carbon nanofibers with 50-150 $nm$ in diameter and 20-30 $\mu$m in length are vertically grown on silicon and transferred completely inside an elastomer by vacuum molding. Using time controlled and selective oxygen plasma etching, fibers are partially released up to 5 $\mu$m length. Macroscale friction experiments show that eVACNFs exhibit reproducible effective friction coefficients up to 1. Besides high friction, the proposed fabrication method improves fiber-substrate bond strength, and enables uniform height nanofibers with a compliant backing.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes an approximate adhesion model for fibrillar adhesives for developing a fibrillar adhesive design methodology and compares numerical simulation adhesion results with macroscale adhesion data from polymer microfiber array experiments. A technique for fabricating microfibers with a controlled angle is described for the first time. Polyurethane microfibers with different hardnesses, angles, and aspect ratios are fabricated using optical lithography and polymer micromolding techniques and tested with a custom tensile adhesion measurement setup. Macroscale adhesion and overall work of adhesion of the microfiber arrays are measured and compared with the models to observe the effect of fiber geometry and preload. The adhesion strength and work of adhesion behavior of short and long vertical and long angled fiber arrays have similar trends with the numerical simulations. A scheme is also proposed to aid in optimized fiber adhesive design.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we show that, although P2P systems and
 DSM systems have been designed in rather different
 contexts, both can serve as major sources of
 inspiration for the design of a hybrid system, with
 intermediate hypotheses and properties. We propose
 the concept of data sharing service for grid
 computing, as a compromise between DSM systems and
 P2P systems. The main contribution of such a service
 is to decouple data management from grid
 computation, by providing location transparency as
 well as data persistence in a dynamic
 environment. To illustrate the proposed concept and
 validate its feasibility, we have implemented a
 software prototype: the JUXMEM platform. 1. A

Our results suggest that declarative programming can provide several advantages over more traditional imperative approaches, and that the differences between declarative programming styles can themselves contribute leverage to different parts of the problem domain.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents Meld, a programming language for modular robots, i.e., for independently executing robots where inter-robot communication is limited to immediate neighbors. Meld is a declarative language, based on P2, a logic-programming language originally designed for programming overlay networks. By using logic programming, the code for an ensemble of robots can be written from a global perspective, as opposed to a large collection of independent robot views. This greatly simplifies the thought process needed for programming large ensembles. Initial experience shows that this also leads to a considerable reduction in code size and complexity.
 An initial implementation of Meld has been completed and has been used to demonstrate its effectiveness in the Claytronics simulator. Early results indicate that Meld programs are considerably more concise (more than 20x shorter) than programs written in C++, while running nearly as efficiently.},

Recent progress in this area has opened up exciting possibilities for exploring fundamental physics as well as applications in quantum information technology; in a series of experiments4, 5, 6, 7, 8 it was shown that such circuits can be exploited to generate quantum optical phenomena, by designing superconducting elements as artificial atoms that are coupled coherently to the photon field of a resonator. Here we demonstrate a lasing effect with a single artificial atom---a Josephson-junction charge qubit9---embedded in a superconducting resonator. We make use of one of the properties of solid-state artificial atoms, namely that they are strongly and controllably coupled to the resonator modes. The device is essentially different from existing lasers and masers; one and the same artificial atom excited by current injection produces many photons.},

  Abstract                 = {

We study robust and efficient distributed algorithms for searching, storing, and maintaining data in dynamic Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. P2P networks are highly dynamic networks that experience heavy node churn (i.e., nodes join and leave the network continuously over time). Our goal is to guarantee, despite high node churn rate, that a large number of nodes in the network can store, retrieve, and maintain a large number of data items. Our main contributions are fast randomized distributed algorithms that guarantee the above with high probability even under high adversarial churn. In particular, we present the following main results:

1. A randomized distributed search algorithm that with high probability guarantees that searches from as many as n - o(n) nodes (n is the stable network size) succeed in O(log n )-rounds despite O(n/log1+δn) churn, for any small constant δ > 0, per round. We assume that the churn is controlled by an oblivious adversary (that has complete knowledge and control of what nodes join and leave and at what time and has unlimited computational power, but is oblivious to the random choices made by the algorithm).

2. A storage and maintenance algorithm that guarantees, with high probability, data items can be efficiently stored (with only θ(log n) copies of each data item) and maintained in a dynamic P2P network with churn rate up to O(n/log1+δn) per round. Our search algorithm together with our storage and maintenance algorithm guarantees that as many as n - o(n) nodes can efficiently store, maintain, and search even under O(n/log1+δn) churn per round. Our algorithms require only polylogarithmic in n bits to be processed and sent (per round) by each node.

To the best of our knowledge, our algorithms are the first-known, fully-distributed storage and search algorithms that provably work under highly dynamic settings (i.e., high churn rates per step). Furthermore, they are localized (i.e., do not require any global topological knowledge) and scalable. A technical contribution of this paper, which may be of independent interest, is showing how random walks can be provably used to derive scalable distributed algorithms in dynamic networks with adversarial node churn.

For the first time, to our knowledge, solder deposition and flip-chip bonding of 3-mum bumps on 5-mum centers of a large array has been demonstrated.},

How do we ensure that the failure of one robot does not cause other robots to be permanently unavailable if, for example, that robot was a leader of others?

Context information is used to adapt services and applications to user situation as well as working groups situation. The paper first presents the data sharing system. It then describes the context awareness service. We explain how data sharing uses context information to adapt to changing conditions and how the context service relies on data sharing to store context information afterwards. Context aware and data sharing services maintain a mutually beneficial interaction. Both services are part of a software framework for spontaneous collaboration over MANets that is developed within the Popeye European IST research project.},

In the paper we describe a technique for coordinating the efforts of many tiny modules to achieve forces and movements larger than those possible for individual modules.

An important aspect of this technique is its ability to bend complex and large-scale structures and to realize the equivalent of large scale joints. Although our results do not suggest that modular robots will replace high power purpose-built robots, they do offer an increase in the plausible scalability of modular robot self-reconfiguration and facilitate a corresponding increase in adaptability.},

We describe a technique for coordinating the efforts of many tiny modules to achieve forces and movements be-yond those possible for individual modules. Our approach is predominantly applicable to spherical and cylindrical modules and their faceted counterparts, but may apply to some chain-style modular robot systems. Thus actuator capacity and range becomes a function of software and dynamic topology as well as of hardware.

  Abstract                 = { Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing
 structured data that is designed to scale to a very
 large size: petabytes of data across thousands of
 commodity servers. Many projects at Google store
 data in Bigtable, including web indexing, Google
 Earth, and Google Finance. These applications place
 very different demands on Bigtable, both in terms of
 data size (from URLs to web pages to satellite
 imagery) and latency requirements (from backend bulk
 processing to real-time data serving). Despite these
 varied demands, Bigtable has successfully provided a
 flexible, high-performance solution for all of these
 Google products. In this paper we describe the
 simple data model provided by Bigtable, which gives
 clients dynamic control over data layout and format,
 and we describe the design and implementation of
 Bigtable. },

  Abstract                 = {The paper presents a distributed real-time operating system (DRTOS) for hard real-time embedded systems such as automotive control systems. A real-time control application program is usually designed as a set of tasks that cooperate with each other through the mechanism of a real- time operating system. In a distributed embedded control system, location-transparent mechanisms are required because the tasks are allocated to multiple nodes. We have developed a DRTOS that provides location-transparent system calls for task management and inter-task synchronization. The DRTOS is an extension to OSEK OS, which is a standard operating system in the automotive control domain. The DRTOS manages distributed tasks based on the global time supported by the clock synchronization of FlexRay, which is a real-time network based on a TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) protocol. By using the DRTOS, we can develop a distributed control application program with location-transparent system calls. We can also reallocate the tasks of the application program just by reconfiguration, without rewriting the source code. The worst case response time of a remote system call of the DRTOS is predictable if the FlexRay communication is well configured.},

Model-based design has become popular in embedded control software design and the source code of software modules can be generated from a controller model. The generated software modules exchange their input and output values through shared variables. We develop a DRTOS with a real-time DSM service to provide a location-transparent environment, in which distributed software modules can exchange input and output values through the DSM. The DRTOS is an extension to OSEK OS. We use a real-time network called FlexRay, which is based on a TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) protocol. The consistency of the DSM is maintained according to the order of data transfer through FlexRay, not using inter-node synchronization. The worst case response time of the DSM is predictable if the FlexRay communication is well configured.},

 publication and retrieval - Dynamic duplication of
 popular information - Transfer of information

 potential for this system to be used in a modified

 application that permits the publication,
 replication, and retrieval of data while protecting
 the anonymity of both authors and readers. Freenet
 operates as a network of identical nodes that
 collectively pool their storage space to store data
 files and cooperate to route requests to the most
 likely physical location of data. No broadcast
 search or centralized location index is
 employed. Files are referred to in a
 location-independent manner, and are dynamically
 replicated in locations near requestors and deleted
 from locations where there is no interest. It is
 infeasible to discover the true origin or
 destination of a file passing through the network,
 and difficult for a node operator to determine or be
 held responsible for the actual physical contents of
 her own node.},

  Abstract                 = {
Recent developments in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are pushing scenarios where application intelligence is no longer relegated to the fringes of the system (i.e., on a data sink running on a powerful node) rather it is distributed within the WSN itself.To support this scenario, we propose TeenyLIME, a tuple space model and middleware supporting applications where sensing and acting devices themselves drive the network behavior. In other words, the application core is not confined to the powerful sinks, rather it is deployed on the devices embedded within the physical world. Tuple space operations are used both for data collection as well as to effect coordination among sensing and acting devices. This paper describes the TeenyLIME model and corresponding middleware implementation.

 peer-to-peer readonly storage system that provides
 provable guarantees for the efficiency, robustness,
 and load-balance of file storage and retrieval. CFS
 does this with a completely decentralized
 architecture that can scale to large systems. CFS
 servers provide a distributed hash table (DHash) for
 block storage. CFS clients interpret DHash blocks as
 a file system. DHash distributes and caches blocks
 at a fine granularity to achieve load balance, uses
 replication for robustness, and decreases latency
 with server selection. DHash finds blocks using the
 Chord location protocol, which operates in time
 logarithmic in the number of servers. CFS is
 implemented using the SFS file system toolkit and
 runs on Linux, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD. Experience on a
 globally deployed prototype shows that CFS delivers
 data to clients as fast as FTP. Controlled tests
 show that CFS is scalable: with 4,096 servers,
 looking up a block of data involves contacting only
 seven servers. The tests also demonstrate nearly
 perfect robustness and unimpaired performance even
 when as many as half the servers fail.},

  Abstract                 = {Tightly-coupled multi-agent systems such as modular robots frequently exhibit properties of interest that span multiple modules. These properties cannot easily be detected from any single module, though they might readily be detected by combining the knowledge of multiple modules. Testing for distributed conditions is especially important in debugging or verifying the correctness of software for modular robots. We have developed a technique we call distributed watchpoint triggers which can efficiently recognize such distributed conditions. Our watchpoint description language can handle a variety of temporal, spatial, and logical properties spanning multiple robots. This paper presents that language, describes our fully-distributed, online mechanism for detecting distributed conditions in a running system, and evaluates the performance of our implementation. We found that the performance of the system is highly dependent on the program being debugged, scales linearly with ensemble size, and is small enough to make the system practical in all but the worst case scenarios.},

  Abstract                 = {Reliability at massive scale is one of the biggest
 challenges we face at Amazon.com, one of the largest
 e-commerce operations in the world; even the
 slightest outage has significant financial
 consequences and impacts customer trust. The
 Amazon.com platform, which provides services for
 many web sites worldwide, is implemented on top of
 an infrastructure of tens of thousands of servers
 and network components located in many datacenters
 around the world. At this scale, small and large
 components fail continuously and the way persistent
 state is managed in the face of these failures
 drives the reliability and scalability of the
 software systems. This paper presents the design and
 implementation of Dynamo, a highly available
 key-value storage system that some of Amazon's core
 services use to provide an ``always-on ''
 experience. To achieve this level of availability,
 Dynamo sacrifices consistency under certain failure
 scenarios. It makes extensive use of object
 versioning and application-assisted conflict
 resolution in a manner that provides a novel
 interface for developers to use.},

  Abstract                 = {The Smart Surface project aims at designing an integrated micro-manipulator based on an array of micromodules connected with a 2D array topology network. Each micromodule comprises a sensor, an actuator and a processing unit. One of the aims of the processing unit is to differentiate the shape of the part that is put on top of the Smart Surface. From a set of shapes this differentiation is done through a distributed algorithm that we call a criterion. The article presents Sensor Network Calibrator (SNC), a calibrator which allows to parametrize the Smart Surface and to determine the necessary number of sensors required by our Smart Surface. The tests will show that SNC is of great importance for choosing the number of sensors, and therefore to determine the size of the sensors grid.},

  Abstract                 = {Modular robotic systems with no fixed mechanical contacts are have the ability to adopt and reconfigure very rapidly, but are very difficult to control dynamically. Moving module solely with electro-magnetic or -static forces can lead to unwanted slipping or even loss of contact. This paper presents a strategy to design controller for such modules based on the limits derived by combining the contact constraints and the actuator saturation. We demonstrate the design of a simple but effective controller for two module motions. We also present guidelines for the design of the modules based on the controller limitations.},

  Abstract                 = {Mobile ad hoc networks offer new challenges for distributed applications designers, such as mobile and lightweight terminals, or the lack of a reliable network infrastructure. In this article we focus on the problem of data sharing in MANETs and we propose a peer to peer distributed shared memory for mobile ad hoc network. It uses data replication to prevent the users needs and the potential loss of data a terminal disparition could cause.These data are editable and we offer a mechanism to maintain consistency between the replicas in an efficient way.},

  Abstract                 = {{Centroid of a graph is a structure composed of nodes closest from all others. This suggests the idea of center of mass average of all edges, weighted by the local density or specific weight. Computing this centroid in a classic way needs a global view of the graph environment. In this paper, an algorithm using ant colony is proposed to compute an approximate solution of the cen- troid using a local view of the graph. This allows to study the centroids of complex networks such as protein-protein interaction networks and also thus generated by social interactions or Internet, for example.}},

  Abstract                 = {When Einstein showed that light amplification needed a collection of atoms in 'population inversion' (that is, where more than half the atoms are in an excited state, ready to emit light rather than absorb it) he was using thermodynamic arguments1. Later on, quantum theory predicted2, 3 that matter---wave interference effects inside the atoms could, in principle, allow gain without inversion (GWI). The coherent conditions needed to observe this strange effect have been generated in atomic vapours4, but here we show that semiconductor nanostructures can be tailored to have 'artificial atom' electron states which, for the first time in a solid, also show GWI. In atomic experiments, the coherent conditions, typically generated either by coupling two electron levels to a third with a strong light beam2, 3 or by tunnel coupling both levels to the same continuum (Fano effect5), are also responsible for the observation of 'electromagnetically induced transparency' (EIT)6. In turn, this has allowed observations of markedly slowed7 and even frozen8 light propagation. Our 'artificial atom' GWI effects are rooted in the same phenomena and, from an analysis of the absorption changes, we infer that the light slows to approxc/40 over the spectral range where the optical gain appears.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a robust distributed algorithm for approximate probabilistic inference in dynamical systems, such as sensor networks and teams of mobile robots. Using assumed density filtering, the network nodes maintain a tractable representation of the belief state in a distributed fashion. At each time step, the nodes coordinate to condition this distribution on the observations made throughout the network, and to advance this estimate to the next time step. In addition, we identify a significant challenge for probabilistic inference in dynamical systems: message losses or network partitions can cause nodes to have inconsistent beliefs about the current state of the system. We address this problem by developing distributed algorithms that guarantee that nodes will reach an informative consistent distribution when communication is re-established. We present a suite of experimental results on real-world sensor data for two real sensor network deployments: one with 25 cameras and another with 54 temperature sensors.},

  Abstract                 = {Camera networks are perhaps the most common type of sensor network and are deployed in a variety of real-world applications including surveillance, intelligent environments and scientific remote monitoring. A key problem in deploying a network of cameras is calibration, i.e., determining the location and orientation of each sensor so that observations in an image can be mapped to locations in the real world. This paper proposes a fully distributed approach for camera network calibration. The cameras collaborate to track an object that moves through the environment and reason probabilistically about which camera poses are consistent with the observed images. This reasoning employs sophisticated techniques for handling the difficult nonlinearities imposed by projective transformations, as well as the dense correlations that arise between distant cameras. Our method requires minimal overlap of the cameras' fields of view and makes very few assumptions about the motion of the object. In contrast to existing approaches, which are centralized, our distributed algorithm scales easily to very large camera networks. We evaluate the system on a real camera network with 25 nodes as well as simulated camera networks of up to 50 cameras and demonstrate that our approach performs well even when communication is lossy.},

Localization is particularly important when the modules make local noisy observations and are not significantly constrained by inter-robot latches. In this paper, we propose a robust hierarchical approach to the {\em internal localization} problem that uses normalized cut to identify subproblems with small localization error.
A key component of our solution is a simple method to reduce the cost of normalized cut computations. The result is a robust algorithm that scales to large, non-homogeneous ensembles. We evaluate our algorithm in simulation on ensembles of up to 10,000 modules, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior work.},

  Abstract                 = {Generative communication is the basis of a new
 distributed programming langauge that is intended
 for systems programming in distributed settings
 generally and on integrated network computers in
 particular. It differs from previous interprocess
 communication models in specifying that messages be
 added in tuple-structured form to the computation
 environment, where they exist as named, independent
 entities until some process chooses to receive
 them. Generative communication results in a number
 of distinguishing properties in the new language,
 Linda, that is built around it. Linda is fully
 distributed in space and distributed in time; it
 allows distributed sharing, continuation passing,
 and structured naming. We discuss these properties
 and their implications, then give a series of
 examples. Linda presents novel implementation
 problems that we discuss in Part II. We are
 particularly concerned with implementation of the
 dynamic global name space that the generative
 communication model requires.},

  Abstract                 = {We have designed and implemented the Google File
 System, a scalable distributed file system for large
 distributed data-intensive application s. It
 provides fault tolerance while running on
 inexpensive commodity hardware, and it delivers high
 aggregate performance to a large number of
 clients. While sharing man y of the same goals as
 previous distributed file systems, our design has
 been driven by observations of our application
 workloads and technological environment, both
 current and anticipated, that reflect a marked
 departure from some earlier file system
 assumptions. This has led us to reexamine tradition
 al choices an d explore radically different design
 points. The file system has successfully met our
 storage needs. It is widely deployed within Google
 as the storage platform for the gen ration and
 processing of data used by our service as well as
 research and development efforts that require large
 data sets. The largest cluster to date provides
 hundreds of terabytes of storage across thousands of
 disks on over a thousand machines, and it is
 concurrently accessed by hundreds of clients. In
 this paper, we present file system interface
 extensions designed to support distributed
 application, discuss many aspects of our design, and
 report measurements from both micro-benchmarks and
 real world use.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article, we describe the hardware and software challenges involved in realizing Claytronics, a form of programmable matter made out of very large numbers-potentially millions-of submillimeter sized spherical robots. The goal of the claytronics project is to create ensembles of cooperating submillimeter robots, which work together to form dynamic 3D physical objects. For example, claytronics might be used in telepresense to mimic, with high-fidelity and in 3-dimensional solid form, the look, feel, and motion of the person at the other end of the telephone call. To achieve this long-range vision we are investigating hardware mechanisms for constructing submillimeter robots, which can be manufactured en masse using photolithography. We also propose the creation of a new media type, which we call pario. The idea behind pario is to render arbitrary moving, physical 3-dimensional objects that you can see, touch, and even hold in your hands. In parallel with our hardware effort, we are developing novel distributed programming languages and algorithms to control the ensembles, LDP and Meld. Pario may fundamentally change how we communicate with others and interact with the world around us. Our research results to date suggest that there is a viable path to implementing both the hardware and software necessary for claytronics, which is a form of programmable matter that can be used to implement pario. While we have made significant progress, there is still much research ahead in order to turn this vision into reality.},

  Abstract                 = {Emerging trends in commodity network technology coupled with key insights from academic research in active memory systems are leading toward the realization of hardware DSM on commodity clusters. We call the result of this convergence active memory clusters. After discussing the current state of the art in hardware DSM, clusters, and software DSM architectures, we highlight the key differences between hardware and software DSM systems and show how these differences are rapidly disappearing in commodity systems---with the notable exception of the specialized memory controller presentinhardware DSM systems. We then discuss recent research results in active memory systems that show that uniprocessor performance can be improved with the inclusion of an active memory controller, indicating that it may become part of forthcoming commodity workstations. We make the observation that active memory support can be treated as an extension of the cache coherence protocol, and that an acti...},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a family of caching protocols for distrib-uted networks that can be used to decrease or eliminate the occurrence of hot spots in the network. Our protocols are particularly designed for use with very large networks such as the Internet, where delays caused by hot spots can be severe, and where it is not feasible for every server to have complete information about the current state of the entire network. The protocols are easy to implement using existing network protocols such as TCP/IP, and require very little overhead. The protocols work with local control, make efficient use of existing resources, and scale gracefully as the network grows. Our caching protocols are based on a special kind of hashing that we call consistent hashing. Roughly speaking, a consistent hash function is one which changes minimally as the range of the function changes. Through the development of good consistent hash functions, we are able to develop caching protocols which do not require users to have a current or even consistent view of the network. We believe that consistent hash functions may eventually prove to be useful in other applications such as distributed name servers and/or quorum systems. },

 As part of the Claytronics project---which aims to build very

 simplify each module by eliminating moving parts and reducing the
 number of mechanical mechanisms on each robot by using
 force-at-a-distance actuators. Additionally, we are also
 investigating the feasibility of using these unary actuators to
 improve docking performance, implement intermodule adhesion,
 power transfer, communication, and sensing.},

  Abstract                 = {We demonstrate modular robot prototypes developed as part of the Claytronics Project (Goldstein et al. 2005). Among the novel features of these robots (�catoms�) is their ability to reconfigure (move) relative to one another without moving parts. The absence of moving parts is central to one key aim of our work, namely, plausible manufacturability at smaller and smaller physical scales using high-volume, low-unit-cost techniques such as batch photolithography, multi-material submicron 3D lithographic processing, and self assembly. Claytronics envisions multi-million-module robot ensembles able to form into three dimensional scenes, eventually with sufficient fidelity so as to convince a human observer the scenes are real. This work presents substantial challenges in mechanical and electronic design, control, programming, reliability, power delivery, and motion planning (among other areas), and holds the promise of radically altering the relationship between computation, humans, and the physical world.},

  Abstract                 = {The simplicity and low cost of capacitive interfaces makes them very attractive for wireless charging stations and galvanically isolated power supplies. Major benefits include low electromagnetic radiation and the amenability of combined power and data transfer over the same interface. 

We present a capacitive power transfer circuit using series resonance that enables efficient high frequency, moderate voltage operation through soft-switching. An included analysis predicts fundamental limitations on the maximum achievable efficiency for a given amount of coupling capacitance and is used to find the optimum circuit component values and operating point. 

A prototype capacitive charger achieves near 80\% efficiency at 3.7~W with only 63~pF of coupling capacitance. An automatic tuning loop adjusts the frequency from 4.2 MHz down to 4 MHz to allow for 25\% variation in the nominal coupling capacitance. The duty cycle is also automatically adjusted to maintain over 70\% efficiency for light loads down to 0.3 W.

Simulation results from a galvanically isolated LED driver (work in progress) indicate that efficiencies over 90\% at 12.6W output power are possible using only 500 pF of capacitance. Regulation of LED current is accomplished by tuning the frequency of the series resonant circuit, eliminating the need for secondary-side current sense and regulation electronics.},

  Abstract                 = {Shared memory is widely believed to provide an easier programming model than message passing for expressing parallel algorithms. Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) systems provide the illusion of shared memory on top of standard message passing hardware at very low implementation cost, but provide acceptable performance for only a limited class of applications. We argue that the principal sources of overhead overhead in DSM systems can be dramatically reduced with modest amounts of hardware support (substantially less than is required for hardware cache coherence). Specifically, we present and evaluate a family of protocols designed to exploit hardware support for a global, but non-coherent, physical address space. We consider systems both with and without remote cache fills, fine-grain access faults, ``doubled'' writes to local and remote memory, and merging write buffers. We also consider varying levels of latency and bandwidth. We evaluate our protocols using execution driven simulation, comparing them to each other and to a state-of-the-art protocol for traditional message-based networks. For the programs in our application suite, protocols taking advantage of the global address space improve performance by a minimum of 50% and sometimes by as much as an order of magnitude},

  Abstract                 = {OceanStore is a utility infrastructure designed to
 span the globe and provide continuous access to
 persistent information. Since this infrastructure is
 comprised of untrusted servers, data is protected
 through redundancy and cryptographic techniques. To
 improve performance, data is allowed to be cached
 anywhere, anytime. Additionally, monitoring of usage
 patterns allows adaptation to regional outages and
 denial of service attacks; monitoring also enhances
 performance through pro-active movement of data. A
 prototype implementation is currently under
 development.},

  Abstract                 = {Cassandra is a distributed storage system for managing
 very large amounts of structured data spread out
 across many commodity servers, while providing
 highly available service with no single point of
 failure. Cassandra aims to run on top of an
 infrastructure of hundreds of nodes (possibly spread
 across different data centers). At this scale, small
 and large components fail continuously. The way
 Cassandra manages the persistent state in the face
 of these failures drives the reliability and
 scalability of the software systems relying on this
 service. While in many ways Cassandra resembles a
 database and shares many design and implementation
 strategies therewith, Cassandra does not support a
 full relational data model; instead, it provides
 clients with a simple data model that supports
 dynamic control over data layout and
 format. Cassandra system was designed to run on
 cheap commodity hardware and handle high write
 throughput while not sacrificing read efficiency.},

  Abstract                 = {Oxide-confined top-emitting 850 nm and bottom-emitting 980 nm vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) 8 times;8 arrays were designed and fabricated for applications of optical interconnects. The arrays were flip-chip bonded onto sapphire substrates that contain complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) driver and fan-out circuitries. The off-sited bonding contacts and minimized bonding force produced very high yield of the hybridization process without causing damage to the VCSEL mesas. The hybridized devices were further mounted either on printed circuit board (PCB) or in 68-pin pin-grid-array (PGA) packages. The transparent sapphire substrate allowed optical outputs from the top-emitting VCSEL arrays to transmit directly through without additional substrate removal procedure. Lasing thresholds below 250 mu;A for 850 nm VCSELs and 800 mu;A for 980 nm VCSEL were found at room temperature. The oxide confinement apertures of VCSELs were measured to be around 6 mu;m in diameter. High-speed data transmission demonstrated a bandwidth of up to 1 Gbits/s per channel for these hybridized VCSEL transmitters.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the Internet today, computing and communications environments are significantly more complex and chaotic than classical distributed systems, lacking any centralized organization or hierarchical control. There has been much interest in emerging Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network overlays because they provide a good substrate for creating large-scale data sharing, content distribution and application-level multicast applications. These P2P networks try to provide a long list of features such as: selection of nearby peers, redundant storage, efficient search/location of data items, data permanence or guarantees, hierarchical naming, trust and authentication, and, anonymity. P2P networks potentially offer an efficient routing architecture that is self-organizing, massively scalable, and robust in the wide-area, combining fault tolerance, load balancing and explicit notion of locality. In this paper, we present a survey and comparison of various Structured and Unstructured P2P networks. We categorize the various schemes into these two groups in the design spectrum and discuss the application-level network performance of each group.},

Our randomized construction improves upon existing solutions, such as balanced search trees, by ensuring that the congestion of the network is always within a logarithmic factor of the optimum with high probability. Our construction derives from recent advances in the study of peer-to-peer lookup networks, where rapid changes require efficient and distributed maintenance, and where the lookup efficiency is impacted both by the lengths of paths to requested data and the presence or elimination of bottlenecks in the network.},

  Abstract                 = {Pervasive and mobile computing call for suitable middleware and programming models to support the activities of complex software systems in dynamic network environments. In this article we present TOTA (``Tuples On The Air''), a novel middleware and programming approach for supporting adaptive context-aware activities in pervasive and mobile computing scenarios. The key idea in TOTA is to rely on spatially distributed tuples, adaptively propagated across a network on the basis of application-specific rules, for both representing contextual information and supporting uncoupled interactions between application components. TOTA promotes a simple way of programming that facilitates access to distributed information, navigation in complex environments, and the achievement of complex coordination tasks in a fully distributed and adaptive way, mostly freeing programmers and system managers from the need to take care of low-level issues related to network dynamics. This article includes both application examples to clarify concepts and performance figures to show the feasibility of the approach.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reports the results of our thermosonic (T/S) flip-chip bonding process development for the assembly of a smart pixel array (SPA) using an 8 times;8 vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) array. The introduction of ultrasonic energy into the flip-chip bonding process increases the speed of the assembly process while at the same time lowering the physical stresses (temperature and assembly force) applied to bond the components. Many empirical studies have shown that T/S flip-chip bonding is feasible, but there is a lack of detailed understanding of the effects of the ultrasonic energy on the bonding results. We are conducting experiments and developing models that will provide a sound understanding and a rational basis for T/S flip-chip bonding. In particular, we have addressed the problems of the impact of joint bump size, control of the assembly force, and the repeatability of the ultrasonic power. This report details our findings concerning the following aspects important to the development of T/S flip-chip bonding technology: (1) Computer modeling to guide the selection of design parameters and provide a basis to study the effects of the interaction of the critical design and process parameters on process yield. (2) Design of a new end effector for accurately applying and monitoring small assembly force. (3) Monitoring and controlling the impedance of the ultrasonic mechanical and electrical system in order to insure repeatable delivery of acoustic energy to the assembly},

  Abstract                 = {Self-assembly, or the spontaneous organization of parts into larger structures via energy minimization, is an attractive solution to overcome packaging and integration challenges. Capillary forces from a molten alloy can be used to both bond micro-scale components and to make electrical connections between them in a self-assembly process. Here, we present a systematic study of a number of metal alloys and self-assembly media with the aim of reducing the metal contact size between micro-scale components. We consider six different alloys or pure metals with melting points below 160 �C, and nine different fluids with boiling points above 160 �C. Tin-based alloys were generally found to be highly susceptible to corrosion at elevated temperatures above the alloy melting point, with Sn being the primary component to corrode and react with the underlying base metal. Using a eutectic Sn�Bi alloy and glycerol at 180�200 �C, we demonstrated the self-assembly of 1500 100-�m parts and 5000 40-�m parts, each in about 2.5 min. Thus, 40-�m square, 4-�m high contacts remained functional for self-assembly. The electrical conductance of self-assembled 20-�m diameter, 2.5-�m high alloy contacts based on this Sn�Bi�glycerol system was 1.9 mO -1 cm -2 .},

  Abstract                 = {Angled polyurethane fiber arrays are modified by adding soft spherical and spatula shaped tips by dipping. These fibers are characterized for adhesion and friction and compared with unmodified fibers and flat material samples. Sphere and spatula tip fiber samples demonstrate increased adhesion, with 10 and 23 times the maximum adhesion of the unmodified fiber sample, respectively. The sphere and spatula tip fiber samples also show increased friction, with 1.6 and 4.7 times the maximum friction of the unmodified fiber sample, respectively. Simultaneous friction and adhesion is observed in a synthetic dry angled fibrillar adhesive sample (spatula tip fiber sample) for the first time. The direction dependent friction of angled fibers is investigated and observed. The adhesion and friction results reported in this paper suggest that fibers with negligible adhesion can be modified to exhibit significant adhesion and friction enhancement by the proposed fiber tip modifications.},

  Abstract                 = {Ivy is a multi-user read/write peer-to-peer file system. Ivy has no centralized or dedicated components, and it provides useful integrity properties without requiring users to fully trust either the underlying peer-to-peer storage system or the other users of the file system. An Ivy file system consists solely of a set of logs, one log per participant. Ivy stores its logs in the DHash distributed hash table. Each participant finds data by consulting all logs, but performs modifications by appending only to its own log. This arrangement allows Ivy to maintain meta-data consistency without locking. Ivy users can choose which other logs to trust, an appropriate arrangement in a semi-open peer-to-peer system. Ivy presents applications with a conventional file system interface. When the underlying network is fully connected, Ivy provides NFS-like semantics, such as close-to-open consistency. Ivy detects conflicting modifications made during a partition, and provides relevant version information to application-specific conflict resolvers. Performance measurements on a wide-area network show that Ivy is two to three times slower than NFS.},

  Abstract                 = {A sensor network covering a large area enables connection to various types of sensors and actuators, but application development becomes complicated because of the uncontrollable behavior of such a large number of devices. We propose the u Tuple Space model for uniform and indirect communication with two extensions to the original tuple space model. The extensions enable efficient range search for multi-dimensional keys and bi-directional communications. Our implementation of our proposed model also integrates load balancing by using a distributed hash table, and the experimental results indicate good scalability in multiple servers. The trial application of gathering and plotting GPS sensor data works well in the field.},

  Abstract                 = {Lime is a system designed to assist in the rapid
 development of dependable mobile applications over
 both wired and ad hoc networks. Mobile agents reside
 on mobile hosts and all communication takes place
 via transiently shared tuple spaces distributed
 across the mobile hosts. The decoupled style of
 computing characterizing the Linda model is extended
 to the mobile environment. At the application level,
 both agents and hosts perceive movement as a sudden
 change of context. The set of tuples accessible by a
 particular agent residing on a given host is altered
 transparently in response to changes in the
 connectivity pattern among the mobile hosts. In this
 paper we present the key design concepts behind the
 Lime system.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a novel application of modular robotic technology. Many researchers expect manufacturing technology will allow robot modules to be built at smaller and smaller scales, but movement and actuation are increasingly difficult as dimensions shrink. We describe an application --- a 3D fax machine --- which exploits inter-module communication and computation without requiring self-reconfiguration. As a result, this application may be feasible sooner than applications which depend upon modules being able to move themselves. In our new approach to 3D faxing, a large number of sub-millimeter robot modules form an intelligent ``clay'' which can be reshaped via the external application of mechanical forces. This clay can act as a novel input device, using intermodule localization techniques to acquire the shape of a 3D object by casting. We describe software for such digital clay. We also describe how, when equipped with simple inter-module latches, such clay can be used as a 3D output device. Finally, we evaluate results from simulations which test how well our approach can replicate particular objects.},

  Abstract                 = {The advantage of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) compared to a centric approach is the distribution of sensing suites. However, in order for such a system of distributed resources to work in a reliable and effective way a smart cooperation between nodes is needed. In this paper we propose a middleware approach for a highly reliable data storage that helps to assure data availability despite the well known WSN resource problems and disappearing or inactive nodes by providing a reasonable data redundancy in the system. Such a solution helps to ease the design and optimization of the data exchange between nodes as well. Our solution is configurable in order to satisfy the needs of the application on top regarding performance/requirements trade-off. The options specify the quantity and quality of the data replication. Additional features like event mechanism that monitors the data and the possibility to issue database like queries increase the applicability of our middleware. In this paper we focus on the evaluation of its capabilities regarding reliability, the consistency of replicates and the costs of the data management. The simulation results for a reasonable set-up show that the CPU load caused by the data replication is low (below 3 percent) and the average inconsistency time is as small as about 0,06 seconds for a single hop and about 0,15 seconds for a two hops replication area. There is still room for improvements, but a clear definition of problems helps to find ways to cope with them in order to achieve the chosen goals.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present the design of a robust
 decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) platform for data
 storage. We use Fragmentation Redundancy and
 Scattering (FRS) mechanism on a file to provide
 fault tolerance capability, and information
 availability. To build a fully decentralized system,
 we consider each fragment of information as an
 autonomous bio-inspired agent capable to choose his
 own place of storage (to move from a peer to another
 peer). To reconstruct a file we have to gather a
 subset of fragments (defined by a minimal threshold
 to reconstruct the entire document), thus we have
 implemented flocking rules to maintain a swarm of
 fragments. These simple local rules allows us to
 find just one fragment to steer the whole flock
 towards a peer in the network. Another issue is the
 use of all network capabilities. We show in this
 paper how the flock mobility (based on pheromones)
 can provide the load distribution, while avoiding
 suspicious peers.},

  Abstract                 = {Hash tables -- which map ``keys '' onto ``values'' -- are an
 essential building block in modern software
 systems. We believe a similar functionality would be
 equally valuable to large distributed systems. In
 this paper, we introduce the concept of a
 Content-Addressable Network (CAN) as a distributed
 infrastructure that provides hash table-like
 functionality on Internet-like scales. The CAN is
 scalable, fault-tolerant and completely
 self-organizing, and we demonstrate its scalability,
 robustness and low-latency properties through
 simulation.},

Pre vious w ork has identified data-centric routing as one such method. In an asso- ciated position paper [23], we ar gue that a companion method, data-centric storage (DCS), is also a useful approach. Under DCS, sensed data are stored at a node determined by the name associated with the sensed data. In this paper , we describe GHT , a Geographic Hash T able system for DCS on sensornets. GHT hashes k e ys into geographic coordi- nates, and stores a k e y-v alue pair at the sensor node geographically nearest the hash of its k e y . The system replicates stored data lo- cally to ensure persistence when nodes f ail. It uses an ef ficient consistenc y protocol to ensure that k e y-v alue pairs are stored at the appropriate nodes after topological changes. And it distrib utes load throughout the netw ork using a geographic hierarch y . W e e v aluate the performance of GHT as a DCS system in simulation ag ainst tw o other dissemination approaches. Our results demonstrate that GHT is the preferable approach for the application w orkloads predicted in [23], of fers high data a v ailability , and scales to lar ge sensornet deplo yments, e v en when nodes f ail or are mobile.},

  Abstract                 = {OceanStore is an Internet-scale, persistent data store
 designed for incremental scalability, secure
 sharing, and long-term durability. Pond is the
 OceanStore prototype; it contains many of the
 features of a complete system including
 location-independent routing, Byzantine update
 commitment, push-based update of cached copies
 through an overlay multicast network, and continuous
 archiving to erasure-coded form. In the wide area,
 Pond outperforms NFS by up to a factor of 4.6 on
 readintensive phases of the Andrew benchmark, but
 underperforms NFS by as much as a factor of 7.3 on
 writeintensive phases. Microbenchmarks show that
 write performance is limited by the speed of erasure
 coding and threshold signature generation, two
 important areas of future research. Further
 microbenchmarks show that Pond manages replica
 consistency in a bandwidthefficient manner and

  Abstract                 = {Creatively misquoting Thomas Hobbes, the process of software debugging is nasty, brutish, and all too long. This holds all the more true in robotics, which frequently involves concurrency, extensive nondeterminisism, event-driven components, complex state machines, and difficult platform limitations. Inspired by the challenges we have encountered while attempting to debug software on simulated ensembles of tens of thousands of modular robots, we have developed a new debugging tool particularly suited to the characteristics of highly parallel, event- and state-driven robotics software. Our state capture and introspection system also provides data that may be used in higher-level debugging tools as well. We report on the design of this promising debugging system, and on our experiences with it so far.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents and evaluates the storage
 management and caching in PAST, a large-scale
 peer-to-peer persistent storage utility. PAST is
 based on a self-organizing, Internetbased overlay
 network of storage nodes that cooperatively route
 file queries, store multiple replicas of files, and
 cache additional copies of popular files. In the
 PAST system, storage nodes and files are each
 assigned uniformly distributed identifiers, and
 replicas of a file are stored at nodes whose
 identifier matches most closely the file's
 identifier. This statistical assignment of files to
 storage nodes approximately balances the number of
 files stored on each node. However, non-uniform
 storage node capacities and file sizes require more
 explicit storage load balancing to permit graceful
 behavior under high global storage utilization;
 likewise, non-uniform popularity of files requires
 caching to minimize fetch distance and to balance
 the query load. We present and evaluate PAST, with
 an emphasis on its storage management and caching
 system. Extensive tracedriven experiments show that
 the system minimizes fetch distance, that it
 balances the query load for popular files, and that
 it displays graceful degradation of performance as
 the global storage utilization increases beyond
 95\%.},

  Abstract                 = {The component systems of a distributed system can interact by message passing or by shared memory. In the former, their programs have send and receive calls. In the latter their programs read and write shared memory locations. Component systems that interact over a channel typically interact by message passing because that is the natural way to use the channel. Distributed shared memory provides an alternative [6, 8]. Here, a distributed system uses message passing to implement a shared memory accessible to component systems on different computers (perhaps on the same chip). The memory address space is divided into pages, and the pages are allocated among the component systems. When a component system attempts access a page that is not locally present, the distributed shared memory implementation brings the page to the component system.},

  Abstract                 = {Metamaterials are artificially engineered structures that have properties, such as a negative refractive index1, 2, 3, 4, not attainable with naturally occurring materials. Negative-index metamaterials (NIMs) were first demonstrated for microwave frequencies5, 6, but it has been challenging to design NIMs for optical frequencies and they have so far been limited to optically thin samples because of significant fabrication challenges and strong energy dissipation in metals7, 8. Such thin structures are analogous to a monolayer of atoms, making it difficult to assign bulk properties such as the index of refraction. Negative refraction of surface plasmons was recently demonstrated but was confined to a two-dimensional waveguide9. Three-dimensional (3D) optical metamaterials have come into focus recently, including the realization of negative refraction by using layered semiconductor metamaterials and a 3D magnetic metamaterial in the infrared frequencies; however, neither of these had a negative index of refraction10, 11. Here we report a 3D optical metamaterial having negative refractive index with a very high figure of merit of 3.5 (that is, low loss). This metamaterial is made of cascaded 'fishnet' structures, with a negative index existing over a broad spectral range. Moreover, it can readily be probed from free space, making it functional for optical devices. We construct a prism made of this optical NIM to demonstrate negative refractive index at optical frequencies, resulting unambiguously from the negative phase evolution of the wave propagating inside the metamaterial. Bulk optical metamaterials open up prospects for studies of 3D optical effects and applications associated with NIMs and zero-index materials such as reversed Doppler effect, superlenses, optical tunnelling devices12, 13, compact resonators and highly directional sources14.},

  Abstract                 = {Popular content distribution is one of the key services provided by vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), in which a popular file is broadcast by roadside units (RSUs) to the onboard units (OBUs) driving through a particular area. Due to fast speeds and deep fading, some file packets might be lost during the vehicle-to-roadside (V2R) broadcasting stage. In this paper, we propose a peer-to-peer (P2P) approach to allow the OBUs to exchange data and complement the missing packets. Specifically, we introduce a coalitional graph game to model the cooperation among OBUs and propose a coalition formation algorithm to implement the P2P approach. Moreover, cognitive radio (CR) is utilized for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) transmissions so that the P2P approach does not require additional bandwidth. Simulation results show that the proposed approach performs better under various conditions, relative to the noncooperative approach, in which the OBUs share no information and simply respond to any data request from other OBUs.},

  Abstract                 = {Catoms are elements of physically reconfigurable matter that can be programmed to assemble and emulate 3D physical objects. The challenge is to deliver power to an ensemble of catoms, which may number from tens to millions of catoms in depth. This work explores AC power transfer through the capacitive interfaces of the catom. 
 Three methods of power transfer are explored: ?Continuous?, ?Switching? and ?Store and Send? power transfer. The Store and Send approach provides charge time scalability independent of the power consumption of the catom, while the charge voltage is also independent of the power consumption of the catom. This is done by alternating between store and send: while the charge time for each catom is constant, the total charge time increases
as the square of the number of catom in series. The charge time and the charge voltage for the Continuous and Switching methods scale with the number of catoms, but depend on the power consumption of the catom.
Charge time and the transfer efficiency for Store and Send power transfer are validated using analysis, simulation, and experiments with discrete components. The experiments prove that a square wave input of 10 V peak to peak, at 1 MHz, through a capacitive interface of 1 nF transfers charge to a 2 mF capacitor in 6 seconds up to a voltage of 4.5V. Using a capacitive interface of 20 nF the charge time reduces to 0.8 seconds. The best measured power consumption in the catom is 10.8 mW, corresponding to an efficiency of 45\% for the 20 nF catom interface. The transfer efficiency improves by reducing the power consumption of the circuits and by increasing the area of the capacitive interface of the catom.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we address a reconfiguration planning method for locomotion of a homogeneous modular robotic system and we conduct an experiment to verify that the planned locomotion can be realized by hardware. Our recently developed module is self-reconfigurable. A group of the modules can thus generate various three-dimensional robotic structures and motions. Although the module itself is a simple mechanism, self-reconfiguration planning for locomotion presents a computationally difficult problem due to the many combinatorial possibilities of modular configurations. In this paper, we develop a two-layered planning method for locomotion of a class of regular structures. This locomotion mode is based on multi-module blocks. The upper layer plans the overall cluster motion called flow to realize locomotion along a given desired trajectory; the lower layer determines locally cooperative module motions, called motion schemes, based on a rule database. A planning simulation demonstrates that this approach effectively solves the complicated planning problem. Besides the fundamental motion capacity of the module, the hardware feasibility of the planning locomotion is verified through a self-reconfiguration experiment using the prototype modules we have developed.
